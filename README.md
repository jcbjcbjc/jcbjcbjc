### Hi ðŸ‘‹
My personal website is https://jcbjcbjc.github.io/

Iâ€™m Chaobo Jia ,an incoming Ph.D. from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html) (CUHK)

I'm now a Research Intern in Bytedance Seed Team focusing on RL post-training and large-scale pre-training.

I'm interested in the area of machine learning algorithms and machine learning systems, including RL algorithm, training frameworks, inference frameworks and deep learning compilers. Here is the list of open-source projects I have worked on:
